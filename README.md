# Form Validation Using Regex Patterns

This project demonstrates how to create a simple form with client-side validation using React. The form includes multiple fields such as username, email, password, and confirm password, with validation rules enforced using regular expressions (regex).

## Features

- **Username Validation**: The username must be between 3 and 16 characters long and contain only letters and numbers.
- **Email Validation**: Ensures the email is in a valid format.
- **Password Validation**: The password must contain at least 8 characters, including one letter, one number, and one special character.
- **Confirm Password**: Confirms that the password matches the confirmation field.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Uses regular expressions to validate input fields before submission.
- **Dynamic Validation**: The confirm password field dynamically uses the password value to ensure they match.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking and better development experience.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling the form and application.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: Used for form validation.
